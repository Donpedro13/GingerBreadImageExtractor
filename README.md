GingerBreadImageExtractor
==========

This Python script extracts end of level photos from the savegame files of the video game Sackboy: A Big Adventure. It also extracts "superseded" photos, no longer visible in-game. For technical details, see my [blog post](https://peteronprogramming.wordpress.com/2024/01/06/reverse-engineering-the-end-of-level-photos-in-sackboy-a-big-adventure/) about the topic.

Prerequisites:
* Python 3

Usage
----------

* Make sure Python 3 is installed on your computer
* Open a command line (e.g. cmd.exe)
* Run the script, and provide an output folder where the images will be extracted

E.g.:

`python GingerBreadImageExtractor.py D:\your_out_folder`

Extraction should take a few minutes at max.
